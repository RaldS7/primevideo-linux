### I made a script that installs wine-staging and Chrome (90) but it's just made for Arch-based Distros, I tested it in Arch Linux on virtual machine. 
### To run that script, download as zip and unzip, open the extracted folder with terminal and run the code below:
```
sudo chmod a+rx arch/arch-install.sh
sh arch/arch-install.sh
```
### I didn't made any script for Ubuntu & Debian yet. 
### If you want to install manually for Ubuntu & Debian, read the install.md file.
### If you are an Arch user and don't want to run the script made for Arch-based distros, you can read the install.md file too.
